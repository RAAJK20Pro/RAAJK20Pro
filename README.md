# üí´ About Me:
I‚Äôm an Android kernel tweaker with a passion for optimizing performance, enhancing battery life, and pushing the limits of what mobile hardware can do. With deep knowledge of Linux-based systems, I specialize in customizing kernel parameters, modifying governors, and applying patches to achieve the perfect balance between power and efficiency.<br><br>My work involves diving deep into source code, fine-tuning schedulers, undervolting, and experimenting with custom builds to unlock the full potential of Android devices. Whether it‚Äôs for gaming performance, thermal efficiency, or just smoother day-to-day usage, I strive to deliver stable and efficient kernel tweaks tailored to real-world needs.<br><br>Always learning, always experimenting‚Äîbecause performance should never come at the cost of stability.
